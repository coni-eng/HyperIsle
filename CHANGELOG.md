\## Unreleased



\- Music Island:

&nbsp; - SYSTEM\_ONLY (default): Uses HyperOS native music island only (no duplicate islands from the app).

&nbsp; - BLOCK\_SYSTEM (advanced): Suppresses HyperOS music island by cancelling MediaStyle notifications for selected music apps.

&nbsp;   Note: This may remove lockscreen/shade media controls.



\- System states (ringer/DND):

&nbsp; - App-based islands are shown only if meaningful customization is available; otherwise HyperOS native behavior is preferred.
